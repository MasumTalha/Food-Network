    <h3>My Recipies</h3>
    <P><small> Please don’t confuse the terms! An RD must have a bachelor's degree in dietetics, nutrition, or nutrition sciences. Approximately half of all RDs hold advanced degrees, and soon this will be a requirement.Becoming an RD requires completing a rigorous academic program that includes courses in food science, clinical dietetics, community nutrition, lifecycle nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, education methodology, biochemistry, microbiology, social sciences, human anatomy and physiology, and other culinary and nutrition-related classes. </small></P>
